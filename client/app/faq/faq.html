                <uib-accordion-group heading="Why is Tablesurfer.de just for students?" is-open="false">
                    <span translate>We didn't want that tablesurfer.de becomes a generic dating site. We offer students, that they can meet people from all universities in Munich and that they get to know people who are studying a different subject.</span>

                    <span translate>No, you can't. There have been many projects around which where just like tablesurfer.de. A lot of them failed because people were not willing to be the host. We want that tablesurfer.de will stay fair and we think everyone can be a good host. Your guests will definitely support you. :)</span>

                <uib-accordion-group heading="I have belly ache! I can't hold the dinner today. How do I tell my guests?" is-open="false">
